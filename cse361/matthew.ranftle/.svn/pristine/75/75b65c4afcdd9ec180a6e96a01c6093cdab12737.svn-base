For homework 1, the way to invoke the auto grader is to modify THIS file
before you do an svn commit.
The auto-grader checks to see if this file has changed, and if it has, THEN
it checks out all your code and runs the grader.
What to modify? Delete one of these x's: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
(the fact that you have this file does not mean that the auto-grader is live,
but it is a good sign that it will be soon!)
