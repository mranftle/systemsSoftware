Name(s):

Table 1. Valgrind Results.
Number of instructions executed:
			-O0		-O1		-02		-O3
compute_totals			      	       		 
compute_grades	
compute_histogram	
PROGRAM TOTALS

Question 1. Name one other thing besides instruction counts that
valgrind could tell you about your code (if you were to run it with
different flags):


Table 2. Gprof Results.
Percentage of where your un-optimized code spends its time:
compute_totals	    	 xx%			      	       		 
compute_grades		 xx%
compute_histogram	 xx%

Question 2. Which function will you improve and why?

Go improve your code.

Question 3. Describe your improvement in 1-2 sentences:

Table 3. Valgrind Results.
Number of instructions executed post programmer optimization:
       	  	       optimized
compute_totals	       
compute_grades	       
compute_histogram      
PROGRAM TOTALS

Table 4. Gprof Results.
Percentage of where your optimized code spends its time:
compute_totals	    	 xx%			      	       		 
compute_grades		 xx%
compute_histogram	 xx%

Question 4. Now which function would you try to improve and why?
